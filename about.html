          <h2>Heritage & Our Story</h2>
          <h3>25 Years of Knowing Better</h3>
      
          <p>
            Our journey into the pulse trade began in the late 1990s — not as a brand,
            but as traders working inside the mandi system.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            We handled grain every day. We learned how harvests change year to year,
            how quality varies by soil, and what actually makes a good dal.
            Over time, we moved deeper into processing, taking control of milling
            so we could protect quality at scale.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            And that’s when the compromise became clear.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Good grain would arrive at the mill full of character — rough, dense,
            alive with flavor. Then it would be polished.
            Not because it needed to be, but because the market demanded shine.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            <strong>NIVAALA was created to step away from that system.</strong>
          </p>
      
          <p>
            We realized that if we wanted to sell grain the way it should be —
            raw, unpolished, and intact — we had to bypass middlemen
            and speak directly to the people who cared about food beyond appearances.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            NIVAALA is not a reinvention of grain.
            It is the result of restraint.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            What leaves our mill is what reaches your kitchen —
            without cosmetic polishing, shortcuts, or compromise.

  <p>
    We mill and sell unpolished pulses the way they are meant to be —
    without cosmetic polishing, shortcuts, or compromise.
    What leaves our mill is what reaches your kitchen.

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
      To build a food company where processing is driven by knowledge,
      not market shortcuts — and where experience at the mill
      directly shapes what reaches the consumer.
      As we grow, we aim to bring this discipline to more foods,
      without losing control over quality or intent.
